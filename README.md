# Brainmade Extension For Quarto

The Brainmade mark is a symbol you can use to indicate that your work is primarily created by you or your friends, rather than generated by tools like ChatGPT. Designed by [Tristram Oaten](https://github.com/0atman), also known as [No Boilerplate](https://www.youtube.com/c/NoBoilerplate), the mark promotes authorship transparency. You can find the [original repository](https://github.com/0atman/Brainmade-org) for Brainmade on GitHub. The mark doesnâ€™t require a work to be entirely human-made; it can use AI assistance as long as the majority of the work is human-made. This Quarto extension simplifies the process of adding the Brainmade mark into your HTML documents.

## Installing

```bash
quarto add parmsam/quarto-brainmade
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory.
If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.

## Using

After installing the extension for your Quarto project, you can use it in your Quarto documents. To use the extension, add the following [shortcode](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/shortcodes.html) to your Quarto document for the brainmade dark mark:

```
{{< brainmade-dark >}}
```

Or the following shortcode for the brainmade light mark:

``` 
{{< brainmade-light >}}
```

The width or height of the mark can be adjusted by passing a width or height parameter:

``` markdown
{{< brainmade-dark width="52px">}}
{{< brainmade-dark height="52px">}}
```

You can also add small button versions of the marks:

``` markdown
  {{{< brainmade-dark-btn >}}}
  {{{< brainmade-light-btn >}}}
```
